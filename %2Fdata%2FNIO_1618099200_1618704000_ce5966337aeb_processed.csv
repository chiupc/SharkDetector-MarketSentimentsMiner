NinjaSwinga,1618689453,US,"While $Tsla s and others success depends on the global demand of only 3% for Ev's, that's nearly nothing, and subsidies  they are getting more and more cut in world biggest ev market china, $NIO creates true demand.  True demand can only be created through intrinsic motivation. And only NIO works since day one to create this intrinsic motivation for NIO Evs, a product which like every other product in our lifes dies over the time, if the demand is not driven naturally.  Nio creates this demand through its brilliant and unique busines plan which includes  - An own social Media app with social commercing aspects (This app had 2018 only 100000 users and now 6 million, this is more than exponential growth. Social commerce plattforms will become according to hedge fund managers who are investing there and me, Ninja MFNG SWINGA from dankshire hathaway for it alone a multi trillion dollar market within the next 15 years and NIO will control a luxury product version of it)  -A universal battery approach to releave the pains, 97%  remember only 3% demand in world for evs  of people still get if they think of the probability of buying an EV. This universal approach includes battery swap, charging and a lot of other solutions, more than any other ev company.  -A unique intrinsic brand value created through the luxury lifestyle aspect together with the luxurious NIO houses which can only be entered with a membership, owning/buying a NIO ev   - And many more things  But there is much more than that. $NIO is the most brilliant busines plan which ever existed in history of mankind.  The membership includes an entering into a whole news world, the multiple subscription services of NIO which will create for the first time in history steady revenue streams with Vehicle customers, customers become only in the NIO ecosystem loyal users.  The margin of EV vehicles will more and more shrink, only NIOs huge intrinsic brand value allows it to make it the customers to pay any price but this will not be needed, NIO will make trillions of dollars alone from its multiple revenue streams and social commerce platform.  You can see, NIO is not the 'Next Tsla' but the next apple, facebook, pinterest, google (datas collected in cars), amazon and an EV company names NIO all in one.  This is the diamond of this decade.

At present, Tesla Model Y is priced above RMB 300,000 yuan, so it cannot enjoy national subsidies. And battery swap stations also appear in China's government work report for two consecutive years in 2019 and 2020.

I posted this exact message for my investors and I thought Id post here also cause it clearly applies to us as Nio investors also. Please read and pass this message on...lets get this ship turned around....  My fellow investors, its clear shorts are in control and Im tired of seeing our hard earned investment go down daily. A lot of information below is basic but Im putting because many investors still dont know how to do step 2 below (read on and you will see)we have invested in a very good company and instead of seeing our hard earned money grow, were seeing it drop little every daynot sure about you, but my investment is down hard and yes although Im long on this, Im not enjoying seeing my investment drip away! Just because youre long doesnt mean youre immune to stress in seeing your investment drop!!   With huge potential, amazing financials and a sound management team, there is no reason why this stock should be dropping. So why is it? Its dropping because fellow investors are getting nervous and selling at a loss to try and salvage some of their investment. They are selling because there are plenty of forces out there manipulating false news, spreading rumours about poor products, management, financials etc. to scare you into selling. When you panic sell youre helping drive the SP down! Unless youre desperate and need the money, DO NOT SELL AT A LOSS!!! You would never take your money and light it on fire, so why would you sell at a loss? Thats exactly what youre doing.   So how can we see our investment in this company grow? If we ALL band together as fellow investors and do the following we will see SP stop dropping and can get this turned around so we can all sleep stress free! 1.       Stop Selling your shares -  at least for 1 quarter (3 months for those who dont know what a quarter is) let your investment sit. 2.       Put a Sell Order with a High limit for min 1 quarter  How do you do this? Its simple and will take you a few minutesGo into your trading account or call your broker and put a sell limit on every single share. Put the sell limit price super high and specify the sell date out by minimum 90 days. For Canadian stocks the furthest date you can specify is 90 days and for US stocks its 180 days. Heres a link for your ease on how to prevent your shares from being borrowed by shorts (https://www.contracts-for-difference.com/borrowing-lending-shares.html)   If we ALL do the above two steps, short sellers will be extremely limited in their ability to short the stock. They wont be able to borrow your shares to drive price down!!! Yes, for all new investors, thats exactly what they are doinggo to google and research Shorting a stock heres a link for ease  (https://www.fidelity.ca/fidca/en/investor/shortingstocks). You will quickly realise that if you follow the above to steps you will stop your shares from being borrowed.   Now, after youve done the above two stepsgo now and start doing research about the company, their products, their future, what is the potential of their product etc.  This company makes products which ARE the future. They are going to change the way we live!!! PLEASE STOP getting tricked into selling your shares to shorts and see your investment grow!   Now sit back, stop stressing and your hard earned money will start to grow. God Bless our investment!   BUY, HOLD, and PROSPER!",0.605,positive

NC,1618608975,US,"Just another positive article reiterated today - Another recent news item came from a rather surprising source. Ford (NYSE:F) said preorders are open in 20 cities in China for the locally made electric Mustang Mach-E. The surprise was that it is coordinating with NIO to allow Mach-E owners to use the NIO charging network, which would become a new source of revenue for the Chinese EV maker. In a statement reported by CleanTechnica, Ford said: Mustang Mach-E users can access over 300,000 high-quality public charging piles, of which 160,000 are fast charging, in more than 340 cities across the country through an exclusive APP. NIO's nationwide fast-charging network will also be accessible to Mustang Mach-E users.  The positive news are piling up. NIO is doing everything right.",0.9153,positive

Milan,1618607119,US,"Fellow NIO investors, its clear shorts are in control and Im tired of seeing our hard earned investment go down daily. A lot of information below is basic but Im putting because many investors still dont know how to do step 2 below (read on and you will see)we have invested in a very good company and instead of seeing our hard earned money grow, were seeing it drop little every daynot sure about you, but my investment is down hard and yes although Im long on this, Im not enjoying seeing my investment drip away! Just because youre long doesnt mean youre immune to stress in seeing your investment drop!!  With huge potential, amazing financials and a sound management team, there is no reason why this stock should be dropping. So why is it? Its dropping because fellow investors are getting nervous and selling at a loss to try and salvage some of their investment. They are selling because there are plenty of forces out there manipulating false news, spreading rumours about poor products, management, financials etc. to scare you into selling. When you panic sell youre helping drive the SP down! Unless youre desperate and need the money, DO NOT SELL AT A LOSS!!! You would never take your money and light it on fire, so why would you sell at a loss? Thats exactly what youre doing.  So how can we see our investment in this company grow? If we ALL band together as fellow investors and do the following we will see SP stop dropping and can get this turned around so we can all sleep stress free! 1. Stop Selling your shares - at least for 1 quarter (3 months for those who dont know what a quarter is) let your investment sit. 2. Put a Sell Order with a High limit for min 1 quarter  How do you do this? Its simple and will take you a few minutesGo into your trading account or call your broker and put a sell limit on every single share. Put the sell limit price super high and specify the sell date out by minimum 90 days. For Canadian stocks the furthest date you can specify is 90 days and for US stocks its 180 days. Heres a link for your ease on how to prevent your shares from being borrowed by shorts (https://www.contracts-for-difference.com/borrowing-lending-shares.html)  If we ALL do the above two steps, short sellers will be extremely limited in their ability to short the stock. They wont be able to borrow your shares to drive price down!!! Yes, for all new investors, thats exactly what they are doinggo to google and research Shorting a stock heres a link for ease (https://www.fidelity.ca/fidca/en/investor/shortingstocks). You will quickly realise that if you follow the above to steps you will stop your shares from being borrowed.  Now, after youve done the above two stepsgo now and start doing research about the company, their products, their future, what is the potential of their product etc. This company makes products which ARE the future. They are going to change the way we live!!! PLEASE STOP getting tricked into selling your shares to shorts and see your investment grow!  Now sit back, stop stressing and your hard earned money will start to grow. God Bless our investment!  BUY, HOLD, and PROSPER!",-0.5877,negative

China showed to US that It would not take any pressure and follow its own economic interests. This sell-off is a punishment for Chinese companies.

Dannial,1618598629,US,"NIO said to announce plans for expansion into Europe on May 6-7 Phate ZhangApril 16, 2021 The highly anticipated plans for NIO's entry into Europe may soon be announced. NIO co-founder and president Qin Lihong said the company will officially announce its European expansion plans on May 6-7, automotive media outlet 42HOW reported Friday. Unlike in the Chinese market, some services, such as One-Click for Power, will be charged in the European market, the report said. Norway has been seen as the first stop for NIO to enter overseas markets, as the country with the highest penetration of electric vehicles in the world. Reports earlier this week indicated that the company's first showroom in the region is coming. NIO will build its first flagship showroom in Norway, and it now looks like it's expected to open in September this year, local media outlet Bilbransje24 quoted Marius Hayler, CEO of NIO. The showroom, located at Karl Johan in Oslo, will be the first and largest in the country, and will form a template for how NIO will be represented in Norway, says Hayler. We start in Oslo, but it is not unlikely that there may be more in other places in Norway during 2021, Hayler said according to the report. NIO has secured 1,700 square meters spread over two floors in Karl Johans gate 33A - on the corner of Karl Johans gate and Rosenkrantz gate, and a stone's throw from the competitor Polestars showroom in Prinsens gate, according to another local media outlet Tek.no. Here, NIO will show off their cars, have a caf and bar, meeting rooms, and a number of other areas, the report said. CnEVPost reported in January that NIO's first stop overseas could be Norway, the first country in the world to account for more than 50 percent of electric car sales. William Li Bin, founder, chairman, and CEO of NIO, has said that NIO's entry into overseas markets will start in Europe first, because there is a consensus in Europe on the importance of electric vehicles and environmental protection, 'the proportion of electric vehicle sales in Europe rose very fast last year, and Norway exceeded 50%, which is very good",0.8654,positive

AJBDrew,1618584422,US,"All of this continued talk about NIO's battery swapping, swap build out, BaaS sub's, etc. just proves Cathie Wood's assessment earlier on when she characterized NIO as a 'battery swapping business'. Many NIO enthusiasts didn't like that, i guess because it sounded like NIO was being pigeonholed,  but she was spot-on.  The issue for investors now is to assess this business model to figure out how revenues and ultimately, profits, will be realized.  This build out will take time, and i think this is one reason why the stock is so totally range-bound, and has become fodder for the day trading MM's.  Investors are apparently looking for some kind of catalyst to provide for a new round of gains.  These days, catalysts are expected to be FAST and furious to draw attention and speculative fervor.  NIO's fervor was LAST year with that ridiculous run up.  That event burned out enthusiasm, so now the stock is deflated and sunk.",0.3999,positive

rich,1618580916,US,"Even as a Long Term Bull, seeing it hit 34 from 67 is making me start to now have some Real Concern! if it does not stabilize very very soon I'm concerned this stock is possibly headed back to 30 or below. The whole Eevee sector hype seems to be lost and you just can't keep blaming chip shortage or manipulation anymore I think it's a matter of water seeking it's true level, at least short-term it's not looking good, but if you have no need for the money there's always a small chance this could take off in the long term, but in the near future it's not looking very good, I'm still holding and won't sell but it's quite upsetting knowing quite a few people bought in at the 40s 50s and 60 and it's going to take them a very long time to get their money back if ever! let's hope for an NIO miracle and things will turn around especially seeing that the rest of the market has been having banner days. so all the pumpers stop telling people to keep barring on the dip because you're putting people's money in jeopardy right now maybe once it starts to reverse the trend and head up then you can start pumping again but right now it's not the right time until it stabilizes. and as far as all the bashers go, investors don't need to hear your silly immature rhetoric, we can see what the stock is doing on our own, we don't need a mature uneducated morons making self-serving comments and ridiculing others!!! have a nice weekend to all the longs!",-0.9267,negative

Investor,1618580430,US,Definitely time to look at seriously adding to positions in NIO and XPEV. I think they are oversold and now affordable and they look especially good for medium or long term investment. There has been no bad news lately and in fact a lot of progress and good news across the spectrum. The chip shortage is not as bad in China and should be over soon. This is looking like a great opportunity over the next year. I also don't think it is a bad play short term. We say similar action a couple of weeks ago and NIO jumped right back to nearly 40 and XPEV jumped to 37. THere seems to be a clear trading pattern here now and I saw the same situation in Tesla as it got its footing. NIO and XPEV are actually doing better than Tesla did early on.

PLTR and disruptive technology stocks have fallen out of favor for S&P and bonds, but that will taper throughout the summer and then it will shift back heavily into these disruptive innovative stocks.  What is good is by then many will be producing product and sales figures will be increasing.  NIO should benefit greatly, as I expect it to be like most of the others including QS, CCIV, OEG etc that produce little at the moment but were priced for the future, and as they begin producing more, the future will again appear much nearer and their SP will go up but rather rapidly.

cloud,1618555105,US,"NIO said to announce plans for expansion into Europe on May 6-7 Phate ZhangApril 16, 2021 The highly anticipated plans for NIO's entry into Europe may soon be announced.  NIO co-founder and president Qin Lihong said the company will officially announce its European expansion plans on May 6-7, automotive media outlet 42HOW reported Friday.  Unlike in the Chinese market, some services, such as One-Click for Power, will be charged in the European market, the report said.  Norway has been seen as the first stop for NIO to enter overseas markets, as the country with the highest penetration of electric vehicles in the world. Reports earlier this week indicated that the company's first showroom in the region is coming.  NIO will build its first flagship showroom in Norway, and it now looks like it's expected to open in September this year, local media outlet Bilbransje24 quoted Marius Hayler, CEO of NIO Norway AS, as saying.     The showroom, located at Karl Johan in Oslo, will be the first and largest in the country, and will form a template for how NIO will be represented in Norway, says Hayler.  We start in Oslo, but it is not unlikely that there may be more in other places in Norway during 2021, Hayler said according to the report.  NIO has secured 1,700 square meters spread over two floors in Karl Johans gate 33A - on the corner of Karl Johans gate and Rosenkrantz gate, and a stone's throw from the competitor Polestars showroom in Prinsens gate, according to another local media outlet Tek.no.  Here, NIO will show off their cars, have a caf and bar, meeting rooms, and a number of other areas, the report said.  CnEVPost reported in January that NIO's first stop overseas could be Norway, the first country in the world to account for more than 50 percent of electric car sales.  William Li Bin, founder, chairman, and CEO of NIO, has said that NIO's entry into overseas markets will start in Europe first, because there is a consensus in Europe on the importance of electric vehicles and environmental protection, 'the proportion of electric vehicle sales in Europe rose very fast last year, and Norway exceeded 50%, which is very good.

cloud,1618534469,US,"Nio Opening New Showroom In The Center Of Oslo, Norway Nio has opened a showroom for its electric cars in the trendiest shopping district in Oslo, Norway.   BySteve HanleyPublished5 hours ago 4 Comments Nio is taking a page from the Tesla playbook by opening a showroom in the heart of the trendiest upscale shopping district in Oslo, Norway. In 2016, Tesla opened a similar showroom smack in the middle of Martin Place, the most desirable shopping address in Sydney, Australia.  Usually, car dealers like to congregate out in the suburbs where land is cheap, but there is a symbiotic relationship between retailers who locate their stores in the most desirable shopping locations. The luster of one rubs off on all the others. For many, a new car is an aspirational purchase. Our cars define who we are and seeing them on display in an upscale location helps burnish their allure.   Image courtesy of Nio  The new 1,700 square meter Nio showroom will occupy two floors in Karl Johans gate, the central corridor in downtown Oslo that connects the main railroad station and the Royal Palace. It is next door to the fashionable Grand Hotel and will include a bar, a caf, offices, and meeting rooms. In the middle of all that, several Nio cars will be on display according to Elbil, the Norwegian electric car association.  Speaking to local news outlet Bilbransje24, Marius Hayler, the head of operations for Nio in Norway, said We are about to open our first showroom in Norway in September. The showroom at Karl Johan in Oslo will be the first and largest in the country, and will form a template for how Nio will be represented in Norway. With its favorable government policies for electric cars, Norway is attracting attention from other Chinese electric vehicle manufaturers such as Polestar, Xpeng, MG, and Maxus. BYD and Hongqi are also planning to extend their presence into Norway soon.     At present, Nio has three SUV models available  the EC6, ES6, and ES8  and has recently launched the ET7, a large sedan with advanced self-driving technology. Nio is working with Mobileye and NVIDIA on its Aquilla self-driving system. According to Inside EVs, the suite of sensors includes 11 8-megapixel high resolution cameras, 1 ultra long range high resolution LIDAR, 5 millimeter wave radar units, 12 ultrasonic sensors, and 2 high precision positioning units. 4 Orin supercomputer chips from NVIDIA can perform up to 1,016 tera operations per second (TOPS).  We will compete in the premium segment against well-established electric car manufacturers. And already in the second half of the year, we will be able to launch the cars on the European market, Hui Zhang, vice president of operations for Nio in Europe, tells Elbil. The ET7 is expected to appear in markets outside of China later this year.",0.9837,positive

cloud,1618533784,US,"NIO says it is open to other companies using its battery packs Phate ZhangApril 15, 2021 Given NIO's relatively well-established battery pipeline, it seems that other companies are interested in using its batteries to save development costs.  NIO is open to other companies using its battery packs, and some brands are in talks to work with NIO, William Li, founder, chairman and CEO of NIO, said after the company signed a deal with fossil fuel giant Sinopec on Thursday.  But that would require those companies to overhaul their own vehicles' chassis to be able to match NIO's battery packs, he said.  Currently, NIO's battery packs can match models about the size of the Tesla Model 3, Li said.  The fact that the batteries can be replaced is the most important label for NIO and a big reason why the electric car company is focusing on battery technology.     The battery pipeline at NIO is currently available in a 70kWh version, a 100kWh version, and a 150kWh version that is expected to be delivered in the fourth quarter.  It's worth noting that even if a company decides to use NIO's batteries now, it seems unlikely to get much supply, as NIO's own supply is tight.  Late last month, NIO announced a temporary five-day shutdown of its Hefei manufacturing site due to a chip shortage and a shortage of battery supply.  Earlier this month, Li said that the current capacity of its manufacturing base is 400 units per day, with a monthly capacity of 10,000 units based on 25 working days per month.  But the supply chain, including chips and batteries, is now under pressure to produce 7,500 units per month, Li said.  Li predicted that the chip shortage will ease in the third quarter, and the shortage of 100-degree battery pack capacity is expected to ease in June and July.",0.6901,positive

This is NIO's inaugural second-generation battery swap station and also the first under the NIO-Sinopec partnership,representing the rollout of NIO Power Swap Station 2.0. The partnership between Sinopec and NIO is an important milestone for further developing China's smart EV industry, a concrete measure to help achieve peak carbon emissions and achieve carbon neutrality, a key step in developing global, green, and innovative transportation initiatives and innovations. As a smart battery swap system enabled by software-defined cloud computing, NIO Power Swap Station 2.0 is the world's first mass-produced battery swap station that allows the vehicle to maneuver into the station automatically. Each NIO Power Swap Station 2.0 has 239 sensors and four collaborating cloud computing systems that maximize the application of visual recognition technologies. Enabled by the technology, users can complete a self-service battery swap with only one click while staying in the car. The system is capable of completing up to 312 battery swaps per day, significantly improving swapping efficiency. Sinopec and NIO also signed a strategic partnership agreement. In addition to battery charging and swapping network development. The two will comprehensively cooperate in new materials, smart EV tech., Battery-as-a-Service (BaaS), vehicle purchasing, and recreational facility constructions to further leverage their advantages in building an innovative collaboration model between the global energy and automotive industries. According to Yuzhuo Zhang, Sinopec's Chairman and Secretary of the Leading PartyMember Group, Sinopec is accelerating its transformation from traditional petroleum product sales to an integrated energy service provider of oil, gas, hydrogen, electricity, and non-oil businesses, focusing on developing new dimensions such as battery swapping high-power DC fast charging. Over the next few years, Sinopec plans todeploy 5,000 battery charging and swapping stations. The partnership with NIO willenable both to leverage their advantages, deepen the collaboration in a broader scope, and ultimately achieve more significant results, promoting a high-quality economic and social development and a higher quality of life for all. According to William Li, founder, chairman, and CEO of NIO, NIO and Sinopec's collaboration will efficiently consolidate their resources and bring a better charging and swapping experience to EV users.

Keembo,1618504808,US,"This chip shortage came at a good time for NIO.   Ford/GM and others are having production cuts in the hundreds of thousands of vehicles right now with Ford trying to limit some of the cutback on their F150.  The more cars you produced, the bigger the effect right now.  NIO is fortunate in that during this slow period, they are building another plant for production.  Meanwhile, the demand for their vehicles is increasing.  When the chip shortage begins to abate in the third quarter, the new plant will be well on its way to completion.  Meanwhile, other automakers like Ford/GM are being curtailed with production in the hundreds of thousands of vehicles.  Much of Ford/GM profit comes from two items, and those are select few brand of vehicle, such as Ford's F150 and these 5 top vehicles from GM which account for 80% of their EBIT. ( Chevrolet Silverado, Tahoe and Equinox, the GMC Sierra and the Buick GL8. ).  The other big profit item is their financing sector.  With slowdowns due to chip shortages, both financing as well as sales of many of these popular vehicles will be on the wane for a few months.,  Besides, during this period of time, more EV technology will be forthcoming which will make the EV sector even less expensive and more competitive for the ICE giants like GM and Ford.  Tesla, XPEV, NIO, etc will be there to pick up the demand.  This isn't going to be a real long wait.  It will be settled out by year end, and at that time full production numbers and sales should be way up for the EV sector, especially in China.  What few NIO ships to Norway this fall should give time by year's end for reviews within the auto sector of that country.  What will follow shortly after year end is the first production of the new sedan...ET7 which should really be a heavy seller and coming to market right at the time production capacity is drastically increased.  This appears to me to be a good timing point to get into EV while it is out of favor and yet looking at a very bright future by year's end.",0.9788,positive

I understand that this board is full of mostly retail investors who can be easily spooked but there really is nothing to worry about here. The fundamentals are improving all the time, monthly deliveries are increasing month on month at an astounding rate. The chip shortage is a short term problem and wont even be remembered by the end of this year. Current prices are vastly undervalued in my view and heavily oversold. Nobody knows when this downtrend will end, but when it does, I expect a very fast rise as shorts run for cover and longs waiting to buy back in. Stay the course and go long, this stock is a goldmine. Let it run its race. Personally Im holding till 200 dollars, or 2025. Whichever comes first. Good luck and ignore the idiots on this board.",0.8753,positive

A,1618504269,CA,"Fellow NIO investors, its clear shorts are in control and Im tired of seeing our hard earned investment go down daily. A lot of information below is basic but Im putting because many investors still dont know how to do step 2 below (read on and you will see)we have invested in a very good company and instead of seeing our hard earned money grow, were seeing it drop little every daynot sure about you, but my investment is down hard and yes although Im long on this, Im not enjoying seeing my investment drip away! Just because youre long doesnt mean youre immune to stress in seeing your investment drop!!  With huge potential, amazing financials and a sound management team, there is no reason why this stock should be dropping. So why is it? Its dropping because fellow investors are getting nervous and selling at a loss to try and salvage some of their investment. They are selling because there are plenty of forces out there manipulating false news, spreading rumours about poor products, management, financials etc. to scare you into selling. When you panic sell youre helping drive the SP down! Unless youre desperate and need the money, DO NOT SELL AT A LOSS!!! You would never take your money and light it on fire, so why would you sell at a loss? Thats exactly what youre doing.  So how can we see our investment in this company grow? If we ALL band together as fellow investors and do the following we will see SP stop dropping and can get this turned around so we can all sleep stress free! 1. Stop Selling your shares - at least for 1 quarter (3 months for those who dont know what a quarter is) let your investment sit. 2. Put a Sell Order with a High limit for min 1 quarter  How do you do this? Its simple and will take you a few minutesGo into your trading account or call your broker and put a sell limit on every single share. Put the sell limit price super high and specify the sell date out by minimum 90 days. For Canadian stocks the furthest date you can specify is 90 days and for US stocks its 180 days. Heres a link for your ease on how to prevent your shares from being borrowed by shorts (https://www.contracts-for-difference.com/borrowing-lending-shares.html)  If we ALL do the above two steps, short sellers will be extremely limited in their ability to short the stock. They wont be able to borrow your shares to drive price down!!! Yes, for all new investors, thats exactly what they are doinggo to google and research Shorting a stock heres a link for ease (https://www.fidelity.ca/fidca/en/investor/shortingstocks). You will quickly realise that if you follow the above to steps you will stop your shares from being borrowed.  Now, after youve done the above two stepsgo now and start doing research about the company, their products, their future, what is the potential of their product etc. This company makes products which ARE the future. They are going to change the way we live!!! PLEASE STOP getting tricked into selling your shares to shorts and see your investment grow!  Now sit back, stop stressing and your hard earned money will start to grow. God Bless our investment!  BUY, HOLD, and PROSPER!",-0.5877,negative

Then, when they have are tired of the new trend they rent and repeat, and in the meantime start picking up depressed shares in the out of favor sectors waiting to rinse and repeat.  Since the EV sector is new, it is in the pause mode until more sales occur and this takes time, especially with chip shortages.  Even Ford and GM as well as others are having shutdowns in their assembly lines due to chip shortages, but at least those shortages are problems that can be fixed and are in the process.

The semiconductor shortage impacts this growth potential on the short term, at least until the end of the year. This means less traders are attracted to the companies and thus the demand for a certain stock falls and so does the price. This all will reverse when the shortage is solved or the first news articles will appear thet the shortage is stabilizing or improving.

Today, that answer is revealed.  NIO on Thursday signed a strategic partnership agreement with fossil fuel giant Sinopec and opened its first second-generation battery swap station at one of the latter's gas stations in Beijing.  Following the agreement, NIO co-founder and president Qin Lihong said the company will add nearly 100 third-party partners to collaborate on battery swap station construction this year, after already working with State Grid, China Southern Power Grid, Dongguan Development (Holdings), and Shenzhen Bus Group Company.  NIO's partnership with Sinopec is currently moving forward with hundreds of sites for second-generation battery swap stations, with close to 10 in Beijing, he said.     NIO will lay out all the battery swap stations that can be produced this year, with no upper limit on the number, Qin said.  In the remaining 260 days of the year, NIO will continue to deploy 299 second-generation battery swap stations, completing a total of 500 battery swap stations, said Shen Fei, vice president of NIO.  The second-generation battery swap stations have room for further optimization and upgrading, such as not having to turn off the air conditioner and shortening the operation time when the battery swap pools are in use, he said.",0.8442,positive

Play_2_Win,1618491056,US,"NIO Inc. (NYSE: NIO) held to its mid-April schedule for announcing a strategic partnership agreement with Chinese oil giant Sinopec Shanghai Petrochemical Company Limited (NYSE: SHI). Rumors of a potential partnership began circulating after Sinopec's Chairman Zhang Yuzhuo visited one of Nio's battery swap stations during the Chinese New Year holiday in mid-February. A Win-Win' Tie-Up: Nio and Sinopec jointly unveiled Nio's Power Swap Station 2.0 at the latter's Chaoying gas filling station in Beijing. The partnership will foster the Chinese smart EV industry and help hit permissible carbon emissions norms and achieve carbon neutrality, according to the companies.  Sinopec is an integrated oil company, the biggest in China, with both upstream and downstream operations. It also has the distinction of being the largest refinery in the world, and has the second-highest number of gas stations in the world. For Sinopec, the partnership signals a move toward transforming into an integrated energy service provider, with an increased focus on developing new dimensions such as battery swapping and high-power, fast DC charging. The two companies also agreed to cooperate in areas such as new materials, smart EV tech, battery-as-a-service, vehicle purchasing and recreational facility constructions. Related Link: Can Nio Stock Go From $40 to $400 In 18 Months?

This is NIO's inaugural second-generation battery swap station and also the first under the NIO-Sinopec partnership, representing the rollout of NIO Power Swap Station 2.0.   The partnership between Sinopec and NIO is an important milestone for further developing China's smart EV industry, a concrete measure to help achieve peak carbon emissions and achieve carbon neutrality, a key step in developing global, green, and innovative transportation initiatives and innovations.  As a smart battery swap system enabled by software-defined cloud computing, NIO Power Swap Station 2.0 is the world's first mass-produced battery swap station that allows the vehicle to maneuver into the station automatically. Each NIO Power Swap Station 2.0 has 239 sensors and four collaborating cloud computing systems that maximize the application of visual recognition technologies. Enabled by the technology, users can complete a self-service battery swap with only one click while staying in the car. The system is capable of completing up to 312 battery swaps per day, significantly improving swapping efficiency.  Sinopec and NIO also signed a strategic partnership agreement. In addition to battery charging and swapping network development. The two will comprehensively cooperate in new materials, smart EV tech., Battery-as-a-Service (BaaS), vehicle purchasing, and recreational facility constructions to further leverage their advantages in building an innovative collaboration model between the global energy and automotive industries.  According to Yuzhuo Zhang, Sinopec's Chairman and Secretary of the Leading Party Member Group, Sinopec is accelerating its transformation from traditional petroleum product sales to an integrated energy service provider of oil, gas, hydrogen, electricity, and non-oil businesses, focusing on developing new dimensions such as battery swapping high-power DC fast charging. Over the next few years, Sinopec plans to deploy 5,000 battery charging and swapping stations. The partnership with NIO will enable both to leverage their advantages, deepen the collaboration in a broader scope, and ultimately achieve more significant results, promoting a high-quality economic and social development and a higher quality of life for all.  According to William Li, founder, chairman, and CEO of NIO, NIO and Sinopec's collaboration will efficiently consolidate their resources and bring a better charging and swapping experience to EV users. Sinopec's determination to invest in green energy service will encourage more people to adopt new energy vehicles.",0.9956,positive

I would say that would make up at least $100-$200 trillion dollars worth businesses in various forms. I would say this is going to happen pretty fast. Probably 10-20 years.   Like Tesla, NIO is well positioned to capture part of this transition. Hence I value all the major pure EV companies such as TSLA, NIO, etc.   I would say NIO or TSLA, all of them are still in infancy. Probably they are well positioned to grow in a rapid pace. 10x or 100x or 500x times their current revenue. That too pretty rapidly in 5-10 years time.   Hence my value tag for TSLA, NIO are about at least, I say at least $1-5 trillion dollars over 5-10 years time. Probably TSLA stock price will reach that range in 1-3 years time. So will NIO...

With the Grand Hotel and the Storting as its closest neighbors, Nio is establishing itself with the first and largest showroom in Norway.  The address is Karl Johans gate 33 A. Just a few blocks away, in Prinsens gate, Polestar has had a showroom since the autumn of 2019.  Library, caf and four cars The new showroom will be Nio's flagship in Norway.  The location in Karl Johans gate will be on two floors, street level and lower floor.  At street level, there will be an exhibition of a total of four cars. One car will have exposure towards Karl Johans gate, while three will be towards Rosenkrantz 'gate. The entrance to the showroom will be on the corner of Karl Johans gate and Rosenkrantz 'gate.  The showroom will be built around the entrance to Karl Johan Hotel. On the left side of the hotel entrance (direction Slottet), Nio will also establish a cafe and bar with windows facing Karl Johans gate.  At street level, areas will also be set aside for the presentation of Nios' 'lifestyle' as well as a separate configuration room for cars.  In the basement there are several meeting rooms, playrooms for children and what Nio calls 'Flexible Activity Room', as well as a kind of library with fireplace.  In place in September - As it looks now, we are set to open our first showroom in Norway in September this year, says Marius Hayler to Bilbransje24.  Hayler is the newly appointed CEO of Nio Norway AS .  - The showroom at Karl Johan in Oslo will be the first and largest in the country, and will form a template for how Nio will be represented in Norway, says Hayler.  - How many representations do you envisage Nio having in Norway? - We will have to come back to that at a later date.  - Is it relevant to open more sales representations than Oslo this year? - We start in Oslo, but it is not unlikely that there may be more in other places in Norway during 2021, says Hayler.  According to what Bilbransje24 understands, Nio plans to present more detailed plans for the investment in Norway at the beginning of May.  Several sources with knowledge of Nio's establishment on the Norwegian market suggest that the company will probably be represented in a dozen locations.  The company has already been looking for people to fill around 15 positions in Norway. This is probably only the first of several rounds of hiring.",0.4408,positive

First bash China, then bash where they are strongest, which is in the EV game,  as they are the ones who will dominate in the end.  Look at XPEV, LI, etc.  All of them are selling more and more cars but because they are not traded in China, US investors can short their shares and pooh pooh their manufacturing.  BYD is doing well today, but that has Buffett's stamp of approval.  Cramer is a shill and always has been.  This stock is giving investors an excellent entry point for long term.  For day traders, they don't care anything about a company other than volatility so they can trade up and down several times a day.  Shorters and hedge funds are playing with the stock and that has nothing to do with value.  If you aren't a day trader and don't think long term, this is a good stock to avoid.  If you expect 20% gains a month, move on.  If you expect NIO to capture the luxury EV market in China, then buy at these prices, go golf and come back next year.  Of course, if China bashing leads to war, all bets are off and that goes for every stock on the NYSE, Nasdaq, OTC, AMEX etc.  In the end, China will dominate the world, or the world won't exist.  Tesla needs China, but China doesn't need Tesla, Ford or GM.  If there isn't a war, and relations improve with China, this stock could really wind up with a high value much like Tesla.

There is no way out even NIO claims that it's accounting process. is in accordence with US rules. 4) NIO is by no means Tesla of China. Tesla is dominating and is the Tesla of China.

@ACC,1618406992,US,"Best Stocks to Buy in 2021 According to Billionaire D.E. Shaw's  NIO Inc. (NYSE: NIO) is a Shanghai-based electric vehicle manufacturer that develops smart and high performance vehicles run on batteries. The firm also has stakes in the electric battery making business, setting up its own facility for battery manufacturing in 2020 that has helped reduce the price of the car by almost 25%. The firm was founded by William Li in 2014. Earlier this month, the company reported that it had delivered more than 7,000 EVs to consumers in March, beating sales estimates by a wide margin.  The company has a market cap of more than $62 billion and posted a revenue of more than $2.4 billion in December 2020. Last month, the stock for electric vehicle manufacturers rallied after US President Biden announced a new plan to increase government spending on clean energy vehicles. Stocks of NIO were up more than 1% after the announcement and have been on a growth trajectory since. The electric vehicle maker ranks tenth on our list of top 10 best stock picks of billionaire David E Shaw.  At the end of the fourth quarter of 2020, 34 hedge funds out of 887 in the Insider Monkey database held stakes in NIO, down from 35 out of 817 in Q3 2020. The total value of the shares held by these hedge funds in Q4 2020 was over $2.6 billion, up from $1.4 billion in the preceding quarter. As of February 2021, DE Shaw Capital Holdings held 15,415, 735 shares of NIO, with a total value of over $750 million.

The NIO OS version pushed to users via FOTA on Wednesday is 2.10.0, the second major update to the system this year.  NIO rolls out NIO OS update, brings support for second-gen battery swap station-CnEVPost Support for second-generation battery swap station NIO rolls out NIO OS update, brings support for second-gen battery swap station-CnEVPost  The battery swap is an important part of NIO's energy replenishment system. The latest update brings support for the second-generation battery swap station to NIO vehicles.     Users do not need to get out of the car during the battery swap process, and the vehicle can automatically park and change the battery with a single click.  NIO also provides instructions for the use of the second-generation battery swap station:  1. User places an order through NIO App or navigation system.  2. After arriving, the user clicks the 'start battery swap process' button at the top right corner of the center screen, and then drives the vehicle into the parking start area in front of the battery swap station.  3. After the vehicle enters the parking starting area, the user clicks the 'auto park into battery swap station' button on the center control screen, which allows the vehicle to drive into the battery swap station automatically.  4. After the vehicle is automatically parked into the battery swap station and parked, the user can click the 'start battery swap' button on the center control panel.  5. After the battery replacement is completed and the vehicle restarts (the green light inside the station lights up and the vehicle's central control panel lights up), the user can drive out of the battery swap station.  NIO rolls out NIO OS update, brings support for second-gen battery swap station-CnEVPost On Tuesday, the long-awaited cooperation between NIO and fossil fuel energy giant China Petrochemical Corp (Sinopec) was finally confirmed.  NIO sent out a media invitation saying it will sign a strategic cooperation agreement with Sinopec on April 15, and its first second-generation battery swap station will be launched at a Sinopec gas station in Beijing on the same day.  NIO will build battery swap stations at more Sinopec stations, and 'you are invited to witness an important milestone in NIO's development,' the invitation reads.     On Monday, NIO opened its 198th battery swap station in China in Beijing. On Wednesday, its 200th battery swap station went live in Beijing.

Preorders just opened up for this new electric crossover/SUV in 20 Chinese cities. Will it be a home run for Ford in China, or will it be a soggy noodle that cant break into the top 10 or even top 20? We shall see.  Ford Mustang Mach-E pricing in China is reported to be $40,000 to $58,000.     One interesting announcement that came out alongside the opening up of preorders is that Ford Mustang Mach-E drivers will be able to plug into the NIO charging network. Which means Ford is paying NIO for that service, and then rolling the cost into the cost of the Mustang Mach-E.  Fords main partner for charging, though, appears to be the State Grid. Thats not as hot and controversial as Ford using NIOs network, though, so its not making any headlines.  Heres a statement from Ford:  Mustang Mach-E users can access over 300,000 high-quality public charging piles, of which 160,000 are fast charging, in more than 340 cities across the country through an exclusive APP.

@ACC,1618352386,US,"NIO Inc. (NYSE: NIO) has been a sought-after trade for retail investors, who are convinced the stock will overcome the current lackadaisical phase and resume its rally.  What To Know: The optimism was evident in a post in the r/NIO_Stock forum, where a Redditor identified as u/rkay0820 suggested Nio shares could go from $40 to $400 in about 18 months.  Nio is currently trading shy of the $38 mark amid the recent sell-off in tech stocks and the chip shortage that forced the company to temporarily idle capacity at its plant. Not long ago, the stock rose to its all-time peak of $66.99 before a confluence of factors dragged it lower.  More importantly, the user pointed to the fact that Tesla Inc.'s (NASDAQ: TSLA) vehicle deliveries increased from 22,000 in the fourth quarter of 2016 to 180,000 in the fourth quarter of 2020. In the same timeframe, the stock soared from $50 to $800.  The Redditor said Nio can go from the current pace of deliveries of 20,000 to 150,000 in the third quarter of 2022, as its second factory comes online. This would mean Nio stock could hit the $400 milestone in 18 months, said the Redditor, adding that Nio is bolstered in its quest for supremacy by governmental support, the booming EV market opportunity in China, premium pricing of its vehicles, higher gross margins, limited competition in the high-end EV market and the proposed Hong Kong secondary listing.",0.4201,positive

tom,1618351181,US,"Good day today longs.  Couple points we have to remember.   1.  Even though production will remain at 7,500 vehicles per month, this will only last a short time.   2.  Production numbers will nearly double again for 2021 vs. 2020 3.  Just like Tesla, NIO is now finding additional ways to generate revenue.  It will not just be through vehicle sales.   4.  Remember, they are in the early stages so dont think $100 is coming over night.  There will be a point when production, batteries and new vehicles begin to really ramp up.   5.  IMO, if youre long NIO youre making a great decision.   This will pay off tremendously.  Stay the course and trust in your research.   6.

cloud,1618339169,US,"NIO (NYSE: NIO) to Tap Another Monetization Avenue as Ford (NYSE: F) Opens Up Its EVs to the Chinese Companys Charging Infrastructure By Rohail Saleem Apr 13, 2021 11:06 EDT  SHARE TWEET SUBMIT NIO NIO (NYSE:NIO 38.18 2.80%), one of the leading manufacturers of electric cars in China, appears to be on a roll lately. Coming on the heels of a major partnership with Chinas largest network of gasoline stations, NIO has now secured another monetization avenue for its charging network via Ford (NYSE:F 12.165 -1.74%).  To wit, while opening the reservations for its Mustang Mach-E in China, Ford has also announced a sweeping partnership with NIO:  Its Official Now: NIO and Sinopecs Strategic Partnership To Go Live on the 15th of April  Ford will also work closely with charging partners such as the State Grid. Mustang Mach-E users can access over 300,000 high-quality public charging piles, of which 160,000 are fast charging, in more than 340 cities across the country through an exclusive APP. NIOs nationwide fast-charging network will also be accessible to Mustang Mach-E users.  As stated earlier, NIO is set to formalize its strategic partnership with Sinopec on the 15th of April. The arrangement would facilitate the deployment of second-generation battery swap stations across Sinopecs vast network of gasoline stations. This, in turn, would allow NIO to lock in a substantial number of existing and future customers to its ecosystem, thereby creating a monopoly of sorts in the largest market for electric vehicles. As a refresher, NIOs Battery Swap 2.0 stations can perform 312 automated battery swaps per day, with each swap taking place in under 3 minutes. The company plans to build at least 500 such stations across China in 2021.  Of course, given the proprietary tech involved in utilizing battery swap stations, Ford is unlikely to tap into this growing network. Nonetheless, NIO does offer its customers a variety of charging solutions. These include a dedicated home charging solution, called the Power Home, and a mobile charging solution, called the Power Mobile, whereby an EV may be charged through a fleet of charging trucks. Moreover, the Power Express is a 24-hour facility available on-demand to NIO customers whereby EVs are picked up, charged, and then dropped off at a pre-chosen spot. Finally, NIO customers can also access Chinas network of over 300,000 charging stations.  In a bid to make its EVs more affordable, NIO allows users to buy its electric cars while renting batteries under the ambit of its Battery-as-a-Service (BaaS) facility. For a fixed monthly payment  $141 per month for the 70 kWh battery pack  users can slash over $10,000 off the retail price of NIOs EV models.",0.9414,positive

As a refresher, NIOs Battery Swap 2.0 stations can perform 312 automated battery swaps per day, with each swap taking place in under 3 minutes.

With its share price languishing in the doldrums since the start of the year, NIO has now provided the bulls a much-needed boost by securing a lucrative partnership with Sinopec, the largest network of gasoline service stations in China.  According to Chinese publications, NIO is now sending out media invites for an event scheduled for the 15th of April where NIO will formalize its strategic partnership with Sinopec and unveil a second-generation battery swap station within the precincts of a Sinopec service station in Beijing.

Trade,1618279155,US,"The 'Tesla of China' might really be the Tesla of China John Rosevear (NIO): Financial media folks have called NIO 'the Tesla of China' so often that it's almost a cliche at this point. But there are some genuine reasons to think that the Hefei-based maker of upscale electric vehicles really could follow in Tesla's footsteps. First, its products are luxurious, stylish, and packed with new technology, but not extravagant. That combination nicely hits the 'sweet spot' of the world's largest new-vehicle market (China's), where sales and margins are both likely to be strong over time. A related point: Owners really like the cars, and NIO wins many new customers by word of mouth -- just as Tesla does in the United States.  Second, CEO William Bin Li and his team have done a great job of building relationships with local government authorities. Among other things, the company has agreed to help make the city of Hefei, in China's industrial Anhui province, a center for electric and self-driving vehicle research and development.  Those kinds of relationships are important in every country, but they're especially important in China -- and Li and company have shown a commitment to nurture them.",0.9938,positive

That the Chinese car brand Nio has been on its way to Norway has been known for a while - in January, for example, we saw a small pile of job advertisements from the brand on LinkedIn. Now Bilbransje24 can tell that Nio will establish a showroom in Oslo, at one of the capital's most central addresses.  Nio has secured 1,700 square meters spread over two floors in Karl Johans gate 33A - on the corner of Karl Johans gate and Rosenkrantz gate, and a stone's throw from the competitor Polestars showroom in Prinsens gate. Here, Nio will show off their cars, have a caf and bar, meeting rooms and a number of other areas.  - As it looks now, we are set to open our first showroom in Norway in September this year. The showroom at Karl Johan in Oslo will be the first and largest in the country, and will form a template for how Nio will be represented in Norway, says the newly hired Nio boss in Norway, Marius Hayler, to Bilbransje24 .  Nine will thus be the next out of the many Chinese electric car brands to establish themselves in Norway. We already have MG, Xpeng and Maxus with models on the roads, and soon both BYD and Hongqi will come with their large electric SUVs. In addition, the aforementioned Polestar, which is partly owned by Volvo and partly by Volvo's Chinese parent company Geely, and BMW's iX3 are also manufactured in China.

Keembo,1618253660,US,"Typical movement in the EV industry right now.  Low volume and day traders are who are causing the present low price in this sector.  Things will change, as the fundamentals are very strong.  For awhile, besides nibbling here, I have found smart money looking at utilities in places where EV sales will continue to pick up.  With Tesla moving to Texas, it will cause more sales of EV's there, and EV's take a lot of juice to charge.  It is very economical in most southern states, and folks should start gravitating toward EV's, as it cost far less to charge with electricity and go the same distance for much less money than driving an ICE car.  I have solar here, with a 6K system, but to travel 350-400 miles in TX and other states in a good Tsla would require about $9 to charge a 90kwh battery.  If you drove 1000 miles/month, you would be using about $25/mo in electricity usage extra from your normal electric bill, so utility companies should be thrilled, and you as an EV driver should be thrilled.  Buying some utility stock in these states where EV's begin taking from the grid should provide good stock increases as well as dividends while you wait for NIO to again take off.  It should only get better each quarter.  Patience is the key, but earn some dividends in the meantime.",0.9823,positive

Yannick,1618253051,US,"an article in the Belgium Newspaper de Standaard  If you want to see the future of the electric car, you should also look to the East. Because while in the West all attention is focused on players such as Tesla and Volkswagen, China is now emerging as a breeding ground for new electric players. One of the most talked about is Nio, dubbed the 'Chinese Tesla', which beckons the European car market with licks. According to many car blogs, it would like to dock in some European countries in the second half of this year. It is not yet known where exactly, although it is suggested that Norway, as an electric car country par excellence, will certainly be there.  For most Europeans, Nio may not ring a bell, but in China the car brand has been the talk of the town for a while. The six-year-old start-up from Shanghai is very reminiscent of Tesla: it builds coveted, super-fast electric cars. Moreover, it not only sells cars, but an entire image. 'When you buy a car, you don't just buy a vehicle,' said William Li, the founder of Nio, two years ago in an interview with the US TV channel CBS. 'You buy a ticket to a new lifestyle.'  Only (future) owners are allowed to enter the first floor of the trendy showrooms of the brand. In those 'Nio Houses' they will find a bar, a library, coworking spaces and relaxation areas. They can call on childcare and network with like-minded people. A Nio car is such an entrance ticket to a select and desirable club.  Change battery The Nio car portfolio is very reminiscent of that of Tesla, but the Chinese company does put remarkable emphasis. For example, Nio buyers can count on a lifetime of free charging, which is reminiscent of Tesla owners who are allowed to plug in the company's Superchargers for free. But Nio does this in a special way, through battery changes: in more than 190 'Power Swap' stations in China, the empty battery is removed from the car and a full battery is put back in in three minutes.  That idea in itself is not revolutionary. The defunct 'Better Place' company, mainly active in Israel, also worked on battery changing stations, in partnership with Renault. It went on the bottle. Elon Musk also proposed a Tesla battery swap station in 2014, but the concept soon died a silent death. Then that concept Nio is in any case more successful. By the middle of last year, it is said to have already performed more than half a million battery changes.  This flexibility enables Nio to sell its customers a car without a battery. They then rent it for a monthly amount, which reduces the initial purchase price. Li previously stated that Tesla is too expensive to conquer the mass market. 'It's like clothes you see on a catwalk,' he said in the CBS interview. 'Nice, but you don't wear that every day.' For him, Nio should become the more affordable variant of Tesla.  Loss The fresh approach of Nio and the attractive image of the brand meanwhile lead many to believe that it is gradually becoming Tesla's Chinese counterpart. In the past year, the stock market price of the company, which is listed on Wall Street, has exploded. Nio became a hype among countless investors in the slipstream of Tesla's price explosion in search of another rocket taking off. The company is now worth more than $ 60 billion. In comparison, that's more than BMW, Ford or Stellantis (Peugeot, Citroen, Fiat).  And that while Nio only sold 76,000 cars in 2020, which were produced in one factory, by a subcontractor. And that while the company has never made a yuan in profit. In fact, it lost $ 11,000 on every car it sold last year. On several occasions, lenders - including investment funds and banks of the Chinese government - had to donate billions to keep it afloat.  According to Li, it is only a matter of time before Nio reaches the necessary scale to become profitable. Tesla has also taken years to do this, he invariably states. The company has big names behind it. The main investors are giants such as Tencent, Baidu, Sequoia and Lenovo.  According to Nio founder Li, Tesla is too expensive to conquer the mass market Fortunately for Nio, it has powerful friends in China. The Chinese government would love to see its own counterpart of the American Tesla emerge. Tesla may be the largest seller of electric cars in China and it has its own factory in Shanghai, but it is facing increasing headwinds from the Chinese government. For example, a few weeks ago it was reprimanded by a regulator for quality problems, and it was recently accused of espionage (DS March 22).  The most important growth market for Tesla is gradually giving Elon Musk more headaches. That should come as no surprise. China sees electric cars as a growth market par excellence, where it strives for dominance. For a company like Tesla, it will be a tricky business not to be crushed in that geostrategic whirlwind. Not the greatest Nio may be busy talking about things, but it is still far from the largest seller of electric car",0.9977,positive

JEFE,1618239193,US,"Most EV investors seem to think that all EV companies are the same, after Tesla. However, NIO has so many differentiators that will separate them from the pack and close the gap with Tesla. Quality and luxury is just the beginning, because that has to be established first to build an iconic brand. They are doing that by winning the JD Powers quality award for luxury EV's sold in Asia for the past 2 years. Their battery swap also separates them, and is fulfilling the government's mandate to provide a quick (similar to pumping a tank of gas) solution for the majority of the people who live in apartments to transition to an electric vehicle. This, of course, will help them dominate China since they look like they will have the standard battery swap in China. They will have level 4 autonomous driving by next year, along with a 150kWh battery with a range of 621 miles. Not even Tesla is doing this!  If you're not paying attention, you are probably making the mistake of putting an equal amount of money into each of your EV stocks. The only other one that might garner that much respect is Tesla, and I still think that NIO is the better value. You have to pay attention to Li Bin's vision, and the masterpiece he is putting together, piece by piece!",0.9755,positive
