NIT,1614686740,US,"‚ÄúNIO concluded a transformational 2020 with a new quarterly delivery record of 17,353 vehicles in the fourth quarter of 2020. The strong momentum has continued in 2021 as we achieved a historic monthly delivery of 7,225 vehicles in January and a resilient delivery of 5,578 vehicles in February, representing strong 352% and 689% year-over-year growth, respectively,‚Äù said William Bin Li, founder, chairman and chief executive officer of NIO. ‚ÄúSupported by competitive product offerings, outstanding services and innovative business models, we have won increasingly encouraging recognition from our users and expect to deliver 20,000 to 20,500 vehicles in the first quarter of 2021.‚Äù ‚ÄúAt our fourth NIO Day on January 9, 2021, we launched the ET7, our first flagship sedan. Boosted by its class-leading dimensions, sophisticated design, superior driving performance and industry-leading AD capabilities, ET7 has received remarkable feedback from users, media and the industry. ET7 is also equipped with NIO‚Äôs latest inhouse full stack NIO Autonomous Driving (NAD) powered by NIO Aquila Super Sensing and NIO Adam Super Computing. NAD will be offered through a monthly subscription service, or AD as a Service (ADaaS). We owe our achievements in 2020 to our loyal and supportive user community and will stay committed to our vision of building a community starting with smart EVs where we share joy and grow together with users,‚Äù concluded Mr. Li."

ximenezxim,1614686345,US,"Nobody knows if NIO sold any car of those sports cars he launched in 2014 when it entered the market. Then in the space of 3 years ES 6 and ES8 models were launched to the chinese market sales wise was an unmitigated disaster due to the high costs involved in the production reflected in the final price of acquisition .$400 million were lost in just in the third Q from launching, the company had run out of money and only a political phone call from his CEO. was able to save the company from disaster after reference investors had flee the company. The chinese goverment save Nio¬¥s furniture through an $1 billion injection and that is what  I know from Nio to cut a story short. Technologically the future of NIO is quite difficult and the EV. war frontline very competitive as there are at least two more chinese EV , there is Germany , Ford and Apple doing their own autonomous driving high technics . All by all I wouldn¬¥t buy a Nio¬¥s single share for more than $20 after having seen this late earnings."
ghita,1614686258,US,"‚Äû  I mentioned because of the constraints of the chipset supply and the battery supply, in the second quarter we may only be able to secure overall supply chain production capacity of 7,500 units per month. But starting from July, we expect to elevate the overall supply chain production capacity. And just like I mentioned before, our partner, JAC has already kicked off their further production capacity expansion. So it means that probably the annual production capacity is going to reach 150,000 units under one shift and 300,000 units under two shifts by the end of this year or the beginning of next year.‚Äú"

Leo,1614681578,US,"From today's Financial Times. "Nio, China‚Äôs leading challenger to Tesla, warned that battery and chip supply constraints would limit production as the electric vehicle maker tries to sustain sales growth amid fierce domestic competition.  New York-listed Nio‚Äôs revenue rose to Rmb6.64bn ($1.02bn) in the fourth quarter, up 46.7 per cent from the preceding three-month period, the company said after US markets closed on Monday, as vehicle sales increased 111 per cent year on year to 17,353.  However, the company posted a net loss of Rmb1.4bn in the final quarter of last year, 33 per cent wider than the previous quarter and larger than the Rmb576m loss analysts expected, according to Bloomberg. Shares in Nio fell as much as 7 per cent in after-hours trading.  Nio has predicted sales growth of 15 to 18 per cent for the first quarter of 2021, after notching¬†record sales in January¬†as China‚Äôs economy continued its recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.  However, William Li, chief executive, said disruption from¬†global chip shortages¬†and battery supply constraints had the potential to limit production in the second quarter. ‚ÄúWe should have the chip supply to meet domestic demand but the risk is still quite high,‚Äù he said.  Edison Yu, a New York-based analyst for Deutsche Bank, said¬†chip supply issues would probably be resolved by the third quarter and battery constraints were mainly due to heavy demand for a new larger battery pack model.  ‚ÄúIn the autos ecosystem, you are only as strong as your weakest link and in this case you have two weak links but I don‚Äôt think that will be disappointing for investors, as it also shows the magnitude of demand [for Nio].‚Äù"

On top of all the above achievements and astonishing ly aggressive plans for future, such as reaching 25000 per month production by the end of year, Nio has seen revenues beat estimates and  top $1 billion for the first time while swimming in %6.5 billion in cold cash.  I have no doubt markets are too smart not to see all the above accomplishments and guidances and only concentrate on small and insignificant earning miss which we see all the time with top notch young but solidly expanding companies. I believe shares will rebound either before or after markets open today and will  close green. I just hope the dip last long enough for many of us to add.   The point is this: the numbers, CC, the future guidance and plans, and Management's enthusiasm and total confidence once again put on display last night, as well as the solid vision by CEO along with very aggressive expansion while being very careful like a master chess player leaves no doubt where serious investors would want to park their money as NIO, in my view, has more potential and promise for future as shareholders and investors than even Tesla.  I am betting on NIO horse more than any EV maker in the world and plan to continue adding on any price lower than yesterday's close.

JAMES,1614677170,US,"Investor Place : NIO is forecast to produce about 26% of cars that Tesla will produce this year (i.e., 130,702 divided by 500,000). Its revenue could be $7.3 billion, or 24% of Tesla‚Äôs estimated revenue of $30.7 billion.  Therefore, the Nio stock market capitalization in one year should probably be about 24% or 25% of Tesla‚Äôs right now. That implies it will rise to $143.25 billion (i.e., 25% x $573 billion).  Therefore, assuming no more capital raises, and not taking into account profitability differences, NIO stock will be worth 2.395 times its present price. This is seen by dividing the forecast 2021 market cap of $143.25 billion by its present market cap of $59.8 billion.  In addition, this implies NIO stock will rise to $100.54 over the next year (i.e., 2.395 times its price today, Dec. 11, of $41.98 per share).  So hang on to your hat. If Nio continues in this growth trajectory we can expect NIO stock could rise 140% over the next year."

Just so that u can compare how Nio did, XPEV delivered 2,223 EVs in Feb that represent 63% decrease compared to Jan.  Nio delivered 5,578 EVs in Feb and represents 35% decrease compared to Jan.

Peyton,1614656427,US,"I like earnings calls because you get a lot of info you don‚Äôt typically get from anywhere else.  Below are those I heard from NIO‚Äôs call tonight.  Intro: Nio currently has 23 Nio houses and 303 Nio spaces in 121 cities.  There will be 20 more Nio houses and 120 more Nio spaces before the end of 2021. Nio currently has 191 swap stations in 76 cities. There will be 500+ swap stations before the end of 2021. The current 127 power charges will grow to 600 and the current 1,700 destination chargers will grow to 15,000 before the end of 2021. There were nearly 100 million viewers of Nio Day. Nio is the first company trading carbon credits for users.  Q&A: Entry into mass/mid-tier market: Nio reduced previous investment into joint venture mass market producers from 40%+ to less than 5% to make NIO‚Äôs entry into mass market possible under a different brand. Battery/chip supply: It remains a bottleneck in 2Q.  Target 7,500 units per month in 2Q.  Batteries and chips will meet Nio growth demand starting in July. Battery costs: Locked pricing for 2021.  Costs will continue to decrease in 2021, not as obvious as 2020 though. Guidance solid contradicting LI and Tesla model Y price reduction: 1Q seasonally challenging for EV makers. Nio will not do price cuts to generate temporary order backlog. Focus on service, performance, word of mouth brand building and long-term strategy to maximize order performance and minimize seasonality. Product competitiveness: No major face lifts for current models necessary before delivery of ET7. Focus on infrastructure, sales and service network expansion in 2021 to give users better experience. BaaS makes EV competitive. Continue to see faster trend of conversions from ICE to EV, great demand and confident to achieve sales target. Nio house costs: New Nio house costs 40% to 50% of original ones. AD as a Service: Decisive on AD as a Service. More friendly to users. Expect higher take rate. Revenue over lifecycle of vehicles. BaaS gives Nio more confidence about AD as a Service. Capacity: JAC current production capacity already reached 10,000 per month.  Held back by supply chain bottleneck incl. chips. ET7 order: ET7 order performance is better than all current models. No exact number offered. Network expansion: Goal is to have full coverage before the end of 2021, i.e. wherever there is Mercedes, BMW, Audi and Lexus in China, there will be Nio. Difference from past strategy is to invest in remote cities in 2021 where there is little charging infrastructure. (I think this is smart.  No competition for sales and better experience for users who drive to remote cities.) Gross margin: Will not lower vehicle gross margin to less than 20% because of AD as a Service. BaaS and NP: BaaS take rate in Feb orders 55%. Nio Pilot take rate stabilized around 50%. BaaS has little impact on vehicle gross margin.  NP helps improve gross margin. Swap stations: New swap stations will be deployed based on users‚Äô data.  The deployment is more accurate than before. New swap stations are utilized at a reasonable rate soon after deployed.  Peak time 10,000 swaps per day.  More and more users who don‚Äôt have charging capacity at home are converted to EV because of swap stations."

Dr,1614649405,US,"üî• Reddit NIO 3/1/21 Earnings Expectations DD To all my fellow NIO friends. I wanted to share two things to be watching during today's earnings call at the close of market. 1) Things to listen for, 2) Guidance and estimates for a healthy report of Q4. GOOD LUCK TO ALL NIO LONGS!  THINGS TO LISTEN FOR ON THE CALL:  Remember that the Hefei local government has signed a deal for a NIO plant/industrial park with an annual yield of 350k cars per year, and NIO also renegotiated & signed their JAC partnership agreement for manufacturing. The JAC yield is expected to be 130k units per year, this alone would take NIO's Q4 total from today at 17,353 units through a 152.894% increase year over year on car production by end of Q4 2021. If you add in the Hefei Government NIO plant, that would bring in another 350k units per year, while the plants completion has yet to be announced, it is safe to say that at some point between 2021 & 2023, NIO will experience a 186.044% increase from todays Q4 report of 17,353 units to a whopping 480K units.  Listen for confirmation of European deliveries beginning some time this year. Listen for any partnership between NIO and Sinopec, one of the only two state sponsored suppliers of petrol; it is speculated that Sinopec is to add NIO's BAAS stations to their network of gas stations in an attempt to advance the conversion from gas to electric by 2025. Listen for any announcements concerning the industry's micro chip shortage, and if NIO has been impacted, or expects to be impacted at all. Any other information about potential new & upcoming models, or and advancement in the AI space as well.Good luck to all Longs and GO NIO!!!Listen to the earnings call at close of market here: https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/zdgba7hc GUIDANCE & ESTIMATES GOING INTO CALL: (I credit Dongxii for his help in assessing the following and providing confirmation of such outlooks to the NIO Long community.)  -17,353 Deliveries Q4 totaling 933M USD in vehicle sales.BAAS 40% Take Rate.  -BAAS separates the battery from the vehicle on a physical as well as financial level. 1) The user buys the car and NIO issues the receipt for the car at a lower sum, 2) The second invoice goes to the battery asset management company for purchasing the client opted out battery for the BASS network. The Battery Asset management company is invested in by NIO, CATL, several other investors, as well as 6 other Chinese banks. The biggest thing is that NIO vehicle sales are reported WITH the battery via the BAAS mechanism, despite it's lower price to the consumer based on the government subsidisation for EV battery rental. This brings the balance sheet to a complete sale each time NIO sells a vehicle with or without a battery.  -ES8 has taken 28% of the total sales, as NIO's most expensive model this is good as it shows a similar level to Q3 at 29%. This means the Q4 average sales prices should be similar for all models.  -The US Dollar is weakening due to inflation, this could potentially impact the reported & converted USD revenue if NIO hasn't preemptively hedged their RMB from conversion loss.  -Watch for other services, Nio monthly subscriptions, NIO Life products, BAAS, should be around 45M USD increasing from Q3 38M  -NIO has received 120 RMB (18.5M USD) Carbon Credits form the Government, this should show up on the operational side of gross margin.  -This should all total roughly 997M USD in revenue values, just shy of 1Bil USD. Remember, NIO only provided guidance for $947.9Mil USD, which in typical NIO fashion, we will have beaten this undershot guidance!  -We should see NIO's margins increase from 14.48% to 15.81%We should see the total operational margin of 15.15% compared to a previous total of 12.94%. Increase from a growing and profitable ecommerce business, as well as the free battery swapping running out for legacy customers. Should amount to 147M USD  -R&D & SG&A expenses should be similar to Q3, an estimate of 100M USD for R&D & 150M for SG&A would be healthy. This could be off if the new battery swapping and sales stores have increased.  -Loss from operations should be  -102.51M USD for a total net loss of 103.53M which is in contrast to the 154,206M USD in Q3   -Wall Street EPS consensus is -0.14USD per share. If the estimates above are close, we could see a beat on the EPS as well.  -Of course, we won't see a first profit until Q4 2021"

Timothy,1614645097,US,"Why I believe in Senseonic so much? Because people in the medical field like Donna, sincerely believes Eversense is a game changer. Medical professionals deal with diabetics daily and understand exactly what these people need. Diabetes is horrible disease that destroys millions of lives each year and costs hundreds of billions of taxpayers money. If we control diabetes with Eversense CGM, then cost saving to Medicare would be billions of dollars each year.  Here is prior statement from Donna. ‚ÄúI have been reading these posts for about a year and think it might be helpful to weigh in. I am a Nurse Practitioner and a Diabetes Specialist. I have placed several of the 3 month Eversense sensors in the past and am a stock holder. I bought it a few years ago when I was being detailed on the technology knowing it would be a game changer. (I also bought in early to Dexcom and Tandem). Patients love this technology and were quite upset when the sales force was pulled due to Covid. It was really starting to catch on. Patients were asking for it and more insurers were covering it. The technology absolutely works and patients much appreciated the autonomy. Sensors are cumbersome and have to be changed about every 10 days. Some fail or dislodge. Eversense is a game changer. My only hesitation (and for my colleagues as well) was the 90 day insertion period. It is a surgical insertion and the site locations are limited. Many of us wanted to wait to push until a 180 day sensor was available in order to limit number of insertions per year and risk of scar tissue over time for longer term users. Insertion, however, is easy to do and was starting to be reimbursed.  I do think that Eversense will end up with a pump partner for a closed loop system. IMO, Tandem makes the most user friendly pump and is paired with Dexcom. It is the best functioning set on the market. Medtronic led with the first closed loop system, but their pump is cumbersome and their sensors have always lacked accuracy issues. The new Omni pod is interesting. They have accuracy issues in the past, that they seem to be resolving with their new pump. They are the only tubeless pump and might be a good partner for the Eversense. So would the Tandem pump. Anyway, I agree with those who think that this stock is a long term hold and will substantially increase in the next few years. The product just works."

With the month being both 10% shorter than normal and a week eaten up by Chinese New Year holidays,  I would think a number near 75% of the last full month would have been in order.  Revenues over the billion dollar mark is an excellent sign and especially along with bigger margins.  Those are the numbers that I was looking forward to seeing for the quarter.

Don't get left behind like everyone else I've left behind every dollar since $2. Us longs have been around the block with NIO and just keep buying more and more.

He is creating intrinsic motivated demand, true demand, independent from subsidies ‚Äì they are getting more and more haircuts.  Our business model is unique on all spheres and it is nearly impossible for others to enter our business and challenge us.  We are the best in Service, the best in autonomic driving, the best and only in BaaS, the only luxury lifestyle EV brand.  The Idea/model/brand/product  NIO acts as a huge pain reliever, creating demand in people for an EV, who never thought about buying another car than an ICE, unlike other EV "competitors"."

Jordy,1614644360,US,"So EPS Q3 was expected 0.17 they beat by 0.15, Q4 was expected 0.07 - was 0.14  Basically they still beat compated to Q3 previous expectations the EPS by 0.03  I think considering the heavy investing Nio does and considering the Q3 expectations, they moved clearly forward.  Cant expect a analyst beat every Q when this is a company growing.  Most important here is margins growth. More profit on the product and that means more free mlney to invest and less share dilution nescessary.  Thats a good developement.  The EPS will come as margins will rise. Thats how it works.  And again compared to analyist q3 origin expectations which was beat big and due to that the q4 were the q4 eps target a bit unrealistic. Yet compared to the original Q3 of 0.17 expectation the Q4 was now 0.14.   Thats originally from analyst point of view a beat of 0.03  And over a year aaaa lot improvement.   In the end this is a analyst expectation I am sure thr company is happy with these results.   I would be as a business owner."

NIO announced a partnership with Intel (Mobileye) to build a Taxi Fleet. NIO also announced a strategic partnership with NVIDIA, QUALCOMM and several other companies on NIO day.  4.

Beloved Nio on the other hand delivered 17,353 in Q4 and guided 20,500 for Q1 and almost 18% QoQ increase.   Growth costs money. In house chip cost money, Nio houses cost money, Swapping stations cost money. Short term losses for long term market dominance, this is no brainer.   Q4 losses were 212M. Nio has 6.5B ended 2020 plus 1.5B raised in Jan 2021.  Zoom out and look at the big picture and determine what you want to do with your shares instead of listening to the new outlets or people on different forums that screaming ER misses.

NIO 200 2021 325 2022,1614640646,US,"1- Tesla keeps cutting their car prices as demand for their cars have been slipping. In Nio's case however demand is been rising hence "Nio  forecast an up to 18% jump in current-quarter deliveries from the fourth quarter, after its quarterly revenue more than doubled helped by rising demand for battery-operated vehicles".  2-Along with rising demand and deliveries Nio beat on revenues today. 3-I remember when AMZN use to show increase in revenues and demand but use to miss on bottomline year after year but shares kept pushing up because market knew it is revenues and demand that matters as bottomline, like that of AMZN, is effected adversely as growing companies plan for increase demand by hiring more personnel and expanding while at the same time spending more on R&D and new facilities and equipment.  4-despite AH so far, and before CC, showing shares down the fact remains that demand for Nio EVs is increasing with company beating on revenues while planning to expand their production capacity dramatically and expanding to Europe.  ---let's see what CC will bring but so far it is looking good; I suspect with CC the shares will bounce back and set up for green tomorrow but if it dips it only provides those longs that know Nio in and out and have been following it for years opportunity to add.

Nio has emerged as a strong challenger to Tesla in China after it received government funding worth $1 billion last year that saved its from the brink of bankruptcy and helped soothe its cash woes as it struggled with recalls and falling sales.  While Tesla continues to dominate the electric vehicle market in China, Nio also faces competition from homegrown rivals such as Xpeng Inc, which in January secured a credit line of 12.8 billion yuan from Chinese banks.  Nio, which makes ES8 and ES6 electric sport-utility vehicles, saw its U.S.-listed shares soar over 10 times last year, as China led the global automobile industry's recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.  The company's stock has, however, changed little this year due to concerns of slowing economic growth from fresh lockdowns as a result of rising coronavirus cases.  Nio forecast deliveries of 20,000 and 20,500 vehicles in the first quarter, compared with 17,353 vehicles in the fourth quarter, but said its deliveries slowed to 5,578 vehicles in February, from 7,225 vehicles in January.  The company's fourth-quarter revenue jumped 133% to 6.64 billion Chinese yuan ($1.03 billion) from a year earlier. ($1 = 6.4648 Chinese yuan renminbi) (Reporting by Akanksha Rana and Ankit Ajmera in Bengaluru; Editing by Amy Caren Daniel)"
James,1614638795,US,"How long was manufacturing down for in February? One to two weeks? They still completed 5,578 deliveries.  That means if they worked 21 out of 28 days, they produced 266 vehicles a day.  18 out of 28 days would be 310 a day.  14 out of 28 days would be 398 a day.  Stretch that out over a full month and the pace is still about 7,980 at the worst, 11,940 at the best, but most likely somewhere in the middle like closer to 10,000.  That is what they have been focused on building toward."

Relative to its 1,000 percent-plus gains in 2020, the Chinese luxury EV enterprise has seen its shares largely stall, having eked out only a meager 1 percent gain so far in the new year. Against this backdrop, today‚Äôs Q4 2020 earnings by NIO have taken on an added significance.  NIO (NYSE: NIO) Fourth Quarter 2020 Financial Scorecard For the three months that ended on the 31st of December 2020, NIO earned $1.02 billion in revenue, missing consensus expectations by 2 percent but corresponding to an annual growth of over 130 percent. For the FY 2020, the company earned $2.32 billion in revenue.  Arrival and CIIG Merger Corp. (CIIC) Will Likely Formalize Their Business Combination on the 19th of March ‚Äì the Transaction Represents One of the Best EV Plays Currently on the Market  (All figures are in millions of dollars)  On a more granular level, NIO earned $946.2 million in revenue through vehicle sales. For additional context, the company‚Äôs quarterly deliveries for 2020 and Q1 2021 (so far) are detailed below.  (All figures represent EV units delivered)  Readers should note that NIO delivered 7,225 EVs in January 2021. As far as February numbers are concerned, the company cumulatively delivered 5,578 EVs, including 1,327 ES8s, 2,216 ES6s, and 2,035 EC6s.  As far as NIO‚Äôs production plans are concerned, the company is ramping up the capacity of its existing plant ‚Äì built in collaboration with JAC ‚Äì to 300K units by the end of 2021. Additionally, the company has recently begun the construction of an industrial park in Heifei that will integrate R&D, manufacturing, pilot demonstration and applications, and industrial support services.  Lucid Motors and the SPAC Churchill Capital Corp. IV (CCIV) May Announce a Merger Agreement by the 23rd of February ‚Äì the Deal May Value the EV Company at $15 Billion or More  In Q4 2020, NIO recorded $133.5 million in adjusted loss from operations and possessed cash and cash equivalents of $6.5 billion.  (All figures are in millions of dollars)  Finally, NIO earned -$0.14 in non-GAAP EPS, missing consensus expectations by $0.08.  (All figures are in dollars)  NIO detailed the following operational highlights for Q4 2020:  In December 2020, NIO completed the offering of 78,200,000 American depositary shares, each representing one Class A ordinary share of the Company, at a price of US$39.00 per ADS In January 2021, NIO completed the offering of US$750 million of convertible senior notes due 2026 (the ‚Äú2026 Notes‚Äù) and US$750 million of convertible senior notes due 2027 In addition, NIO entered into separate and individually privately negotiated agreements with certain holders of its outstanding 4.50% convertible senior notes due 2024 (the ‚Äú2024 Notes‚Äù) to exchange approximately US$581.7 million principal amount of the outstanding 2024 Notes for its American Depositary Shares In February 2021, NIO completed the increase of its controlling equity interests in NIO China through the purchase of certain investors‚Äô equity interests and the subscription for newly increased registered capital.

Moreover, the company expects to earn a revenue of between $1.13 billion and $1.16 billion in the first quarter of the year.    Source  Investors have reacted negatively to NIO‚Äôs Q4 2020 earnings release, with the stock posting a loss of over 3 percent in the after-hours trading as the company missed consensus expectations on revenue and EPS.  As part of its NIO Day 2020 event, the company had removed the wraps from its ET7 sedan on the 09th of January 2021. With a range of over 1,000 km when equipped with a 150-kWh battery pack, the ET7 is expected to debut in Q1 2022. At the event, NIO also unveiled a new 150-kWh semi-solid-state battery that will launch in Q4 2022 and offer an energy density of 360 Wh/kg. Additionally, NIO also revealed its Autonomous Driving feature, dubbed Aquila Sensing. Aquila consists of 33 sensors, including 11 8MP high-res cameras, a lidar unit with a 1550nm laser and 120-degree field of view, a 5mmWave radar, 12 ultrasonic sensors, and 2 high-precision positioning units. The sensor data is processed by an on-board computer, ADAM. The system is built upon 4x NVIDIA Drive Orin SoC and boasts a total computing power of 1,016 Tera Operations Per Second (TOPS). Finally, NIO also unveiled its Battery Swap 2.0 stations that can perform 312 automated swaps per day, with each battery swap taking place in under 3 minutes. The company has achieved this by eliminating the lift step required by the first-generation stations. These stations will begin to be deployed by April 2021.

What Happened: Nio is planning to start exporting to Europe in the second half of 2021, CEO William Li said during a web conference, cnEV Post reported, citing automotive media outlet Bitauto Following the European foray, the company is reportedly eyeing expansion into other international markets in 2022. The proportion of electric vehicle sales has risen very quickly in Europe in 2020, and in Norway, EVs accounted for about 50% of total vehicle sales, Li reportedly said. The European market will be almost a seamless transition, as the automotive regulations there are similar to China's, Li said. User perception and the policy environment in Europe are EV-friendly, he reportedly said.  Li also sees a friendly geopolitical climate given the China-Europe Investment Agreement that is in place, the report said."

But issues in China could impact Model Y sales there.  Tesla delivered a combined* 442,511 Model 3 and Model Ys globally in 2020. And a bigger and bigger chunk of that number is Model Y sales. In the U.S., the Model Y is trending toward catching the Model 3, as the latter‚Äôs sales numbers drop.  Tesla Model 3 U.S. sales in 2020 were 95,135, down 32% year-over-year, according to Experian (via Automotive News and InsideEVs). Meanwhile Tesla Model Y sales surged to 71,344 ‚Äî and that‚Äôs not even a full year because sales didn‚Äôt begin until March.  Price has something to do with that. The Model Y has been getting regular discounts. The price was reduced once already in July by $3,000. And the latest cut this past week puts the Model Y below $40,000 for the first time."

cloud,1614607979,US,"Tesla China's move sparks speculation it may support battery swap, a model central to NIO  Tesla China's business registration recently added "sales of battery swap facilities for new energy vehicles," according to data provider Tianyancha, sparking speculation that it may support battery swap like NIO.  Beijing Business Today was the first to report the change, saying it means Tesla is now eligible to offer battery swap service options for its models in China or to sell new energy vehicle battery swap facilities to third-party organizations.  But the report cites Tesla sources as saying, "Tesla will not adopt battery swap."  In fact, Tesla CEO Elon Musk demonstrated battery swap technology in 2013.  The company's flagship sedan Model S used to support battery swap, saying, "this provides Model S owners with a faster way to charge their vehicles when driving long distances."  But Tesla eventually withdrew support for battery swap because of the high investment and meager revenue involved in building battery swap stations.  China's new subsidy policy for new energy vehicles effective last year said that only new energy vehicles priced at no more than RMB 300,000 ($46,420) are eligible for the new round of subsidies, while models that support battery swap mode are not subject to this rule.  Tesla China's Model Y and Model 3 performance versions are priced above RMB 300,000.  Since its establishment in 2014, NIO has developed a unique model with a battery swap, in addition to supporting super-fast charging similar to Tesla. Its battery swap time has been reduced from 3 minutes to 90 seconds.  Other major players including Geely, Changan, and SAIC Roewe have all launched battery swap-enabled models, but they are all aimed at the cab market, and NIO is the only car company currently offering battery swap-enabled models to individual car buyers.  During this year's Chinese New Year, NIO battery swap stations made 43,500 battery swaps, a 528% increase from the previous year.  NIO plans to have 500 battery swap stations in China by the end of 2021; currently, the company has about 200 battery swap stations."

Nova,1614605338,US,"As expected, new month brings back infusion of cash back into the market as indexes and stocks are green in premarket. But if you're smart, you don't care about these weekly up and down cycles...because the overall momentum is growth upwards. And you're too busy picking up cheaper shares under 50 while you can. As I said last week, I expect a positive ER and a healthy Feb delivery number, even with Chinese holiday that may have slowed down deliveries, which is traditional for a lot of China's consumer spending during February. So don't be surprised if the delivery numbers aren't dramatically higher. We should see the numbers continue the monthly increase in March. There isn't much else to add that you can't see in my history of posts, but I would recommend you add shares of other good companies today as well that have pulled back as well...everything I've been keep a close eye that I told you guys about last week is up 4%+ in premarket: NIO, PLTR, FRSX (up 21%+), NNDM, PLUG, XPEV. Report the shorts as spam. Read my previous posts. Keep buying and holding all of these until early retirement."
